# Module-2-Challenge-Professional-Portfolio

## Description

In this project, I created my first professional portfolio. I wanted to create a landing page where other developers and potential employers can come and see my work. I solved a big problem which is disorganization. I was able to organization my contact information, projects, and descriptions into one webpage where users may visit and learn all about me!
I learned many new topics while creating this professional portfolio and I will continue to improve this as my knowledge of programming grows larger!
